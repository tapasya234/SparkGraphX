Assignment 5

Input: graphX.scala
Dataset: CA-HepTh.txt
For the sake of conveience, the first four lines of the dataset were removed. 

In the code file, the first part is just the general implementation of the graph. 
Before code for each questions are demarcated using comments. The output also is demarcated. 
A screenshot title 'output.png' shows the output for the first four questions.

Currently the code for Q5 is commented because it is raising an error.  The screenshot of the error being raised is in the file called 'error.png'.
